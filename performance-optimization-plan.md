- Lazy loading for images below the fold
- Image compression and optimization
- Proper alt text for SEO and accessibility

### 2. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading
- Route-based code splitting
- Component lazy loading
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Lazy loading of non-critical JavaScript

### 3. Bundle Optimization
- Tree shaking to remove unused code
- Minification and compression
- CSS optimization and purging
- Vendor chunk splitting

### 4. Caching Strategies
- Browser caching headers
- Service worker implementation
- Static asset caching
- API response caching

### 5. Critical Resource Optimization
- Critical CSS inlining
- Font optimization and preloading
- Resource hints (preload, prefetch, preconnect)
- Above-the-fold content prioritization

### 6. Runtime Performance
- React.memo for component optimization
- useMemo and useCallback for expensive operations
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Debouncing for search and input operations
